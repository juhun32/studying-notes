# Step 1: Define the problem and gather data

# Assuming you have already prepared your training data and labels
train_data = [...]  # Your training data
train_labels = [...]  # Your training labels

# Step 2: Define and configure the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=()))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Step 3: Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 4: Train the model
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Optionally, you can include validation data:
# model.fit(train_data, train_labels, validation_split=0.2, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Step 5: Evaluate the model
test_data = [...]  # Your test data
test_labels = [...]  # Your test labels

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Step 6: Make predictions
new_data = [...]  # New data for prediction

predictions = model.predict(new_data)
